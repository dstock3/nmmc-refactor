I must also note that the film’s pacing is unlike the mainstream films that you may be used to. While Skinamarink may challenge your attention span in addition to your comfort level, I believe it has the potential to be a truly transformative and thought-provoking viewing experience for those brave enough to endure it.",

Elden Ring was developed by FromSoftware, a company largely known for Dark Souls. FromSoftware games have a notorious reputation for being extremely difficult. I’m not going to say Elden Ring isn’t difficult, but if you’re a moderately experienced gamer, I think you’ll be able to get the hang of it fairly quickly. The UI is a little wonky, and rest assured, you will die countless times in your quest to become the Elden Lord, but if you have some persistence, you can beat this game in a reasonable amount of time. It took me about 70 hours. I’d argue that the majority of its content constitutes a grotesque mockery of Feudalism’s ideological foundations.",
